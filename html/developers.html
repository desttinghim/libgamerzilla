<p><h2>Why should I support it?</h2></p>

<p>Right now Steam, Epic, GOG, PS4 and Xbox have an achievement system. Will
itch.io add an achievement system? How many builds do you want to make every
time you make an update? Gamerzilla is not tied to any store.</p>

<p><h2>How does it upload results?</h2></p>

<p>The intent is for games to communicate with a game launcher through
loopback network port or other interprocess communication. The launcher
would store server name and authentication information. That way the player
doesn't need to worry about entering it into each game and the developer
doesn't need to worry about storing it securely. If the player does not have
a launcher all data will be stored locally. Players can choose not to
connect their launcher to an online service in which it is all stored
locally and the launcher can still display it. If they choose to setup an
account later or have to move to a different service for some reason, all
their achievements will be automatically synched.</p>

<p><h2>What game launchers and servers support it?</h2></p>

<p>No game launchers at the moment but GameHub support is waiting to be merged.
For servers, only Hubzilla has a plugin to receive and display the
achievements. From a numbers perspective it makes no sense to support it but
that is what led to the dominance of Steam. Game developers have the ability
to take control back.</p>

<p><h2>Why are there no hidden achievements?</h2></p>

<p>Because they don't work. Multiple sites display the hidden achievements.
The PS4 allows you to look at the achievements by just selecting the hidden
achievement.</p>

<p><h2>Why are you not storing the time?</h2></p>

<p>The more we track the more information we leak to others. I've chosen to
avoid that collection. If enough people request the feature I will consider
it.</p>

<p><h2>How do I add support in a C/C++ game?</h2></p>

<p>Create a json file to contain all the trophies. Typically the file has the
game extension.</p>

<pre>{
        "shortname": "mygame",
        "name": "My Game",
        "image": "gamerzilla/mygame.png",
        "version": "1",
        "trophy": [
                {
                        "trophy_name": "Win Game",
                        "trophy_desc": "You completed the game.",
                        "max_progress": "0",
                        "trueimage": "gamerzilla/win1.png",
                        "falseimage": "gamerzilla/win0.png"
                },
                {
                        "trophy_name": "Slayer",
                        "trophy_desc": "Kill 100 enemies.",
                        "max_progress": "100",
                        "trueimage": "gamerzilla/slayer1.png",
                        "falseimage": "gamerzilla/slayer0.png"
                }
        ]
}</pre>

<p>In the C/C++ code:</p>

<pre>GamerzillaStart(false, "save/");
ing game_id = GamerzillaSetGameFromFile("./gamerzilla/mygame.game", "./");
...
GamerzillaSetTophy(game_id, "Win Game");
...
int progress;
GamerzillaGetTrophyStat(game_id, "Slayer", &progress)
GamerzillaSetTophyStat(game_id, "Slayer", progress + 2);
...
GamerzillaQuit();</pre>
