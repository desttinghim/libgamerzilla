<p><h2>Why should I support it?</h2></p>

<p>Right now Steam, Epic, GOG, PS4 and Xbox have an achievement system. Will
itch.io add an achievement system? Gamerzilla is not tied to any store. With
enough support game developers will consider Gamerzilla achievements a needed
feature. Additionally this is the only system that all open source games can
use.</p>

<p><h2>How do I add support in a C/C++ launcher?</h2></p>

<p>Initialization code is simply calling GamerzillaStart and
GamerzillaConnect. GamerzillaConnect is only needed to upload results.
Achievements can be displayed locally without connecting.</p>

<pre>GamerzillaStart(true, "save/");
GamerzillaConnect("http://hubzilla.instance/", "username", "password");</pre>

<p>There will need to be a thread periodically calling GamerzillaServerProcess
to get information from games and relay it to the Gamerzilla server (if
connected). To avoid manually configuring the Gamerzilla short name with each
game, it is good to install a callback for activity. The callback provides
the Gamerzilla short name and the game name so that you can automatically match
up the information.</p>

<p>To get achievement information, you call the GamerzillaGetGame function to
get the game ID. With the game ID, you can get the number of achievements, which
have been achieved, and details of the achievements. GameHub support for
Gamerzilla has been submitted to the project if you need an example
implementation. Feel free to email
<a href="mailto:dulsi@identicalsoftware.com">dulsi@identicalsoftware.com</a> if
you have any problems.</p>
