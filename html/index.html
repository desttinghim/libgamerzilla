<p><h2>What is it?</h2></p>

<p>Gamerzilla is a trophy/achievement system for games. It can use Hubzilla to
display your results online or can keep your results locally. Games use the
LibGamerzilla library to specify what trophies are available and when you have
achieved them. Games can be designed to interact directly with Hubzilla to
store results but then you need to config your Hubzilla information in every
game. The expectation is that a game manager like GameHub will use
LibGamerzilla to collect results and upload changes if you want. LibGamerzilla
is available for use by both open source games and proprietary games.</p>

<p><h2>Will it support something other than Hubzilla?</h2></p>

<p>We would like to support other social networking systems if possible. A
standalone could also be developed.</p>
